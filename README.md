# Computer Organization & Assembly Projects

I built this collection of Assembly programs to deepen my understanding of how software interacts with hardware.

While my primary focus is **Fullstack Development**, I believe that understanding memory management and processor logic at the low level helps write more efficient high-level code.

## What I Learned

These projects focus on the fundamentals of computing:

- **Memory Management:** Manually calculating memory offsets for 2D arrays (Matrices).
- **Optimization:** Reducing instruction counts by managing register allocation efficiently.
- **Control Flow:** Implementing complex logic (loops, branching, error handling) without high-level abstractions.

## Project Overview

### 1. Algorithms & Logic

- **Quadratic Equation Solver:** A program that calculates roots for quadratic equations, handling real and complex numbers. It demonstrates how to manage floating-point operations and conditional branching at the hardware level.
- **Register Optimization:** An implementation of complex arithmetic expressions designed to minimize memory access by maximizing register reuse.

### 2. Memory & Data Structures

- **Matrix Traversal:** Programs that access specific elements in a 4x4 matrix using direct memory addressing.
- **Array Statistics:** A tool to calculate sums and averages of integer arrays, featuring overflow protection logic.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Assembly (MIPS/x86)
- **Concepts:** ALU Operations, Stack Management, Memory Addressing, Binary Arithmetic.
